# custom-chess-api

Custom Chess API is the backend of the Custom Chess website. Authenticated and authorized users will be able to create games using custom boards and pieces, and matchmake against other users. Everyone will be able to read existing games and user statistics

## Purpose

Custom Chess API exists to manage games and validate pieces. Running the chess engine server-side ensures that users cannot modify or circumvent its rules. This is intended only for player-versus-player games and will not support player-versus-computer games due to limitations of the current engine.
